# Task 04: Hand Gesture Recognition using Computer Vision

## 📌 Objective
To build a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and gesture-based control systems.

## 🧠 Dataset
The **Hand Gesture Dataset** consists of labeled images representing various gestures such as:
- Thumbs Up
- Stop ✋
- Victory ✌️
- Fist ✊
- Palm 🖐️

Images were preprocessed and augmented for improved model performance.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Augmentation & Preprocessing
- CNN (or other models like SVM / MLP)
- Training & Evaluation
- Real-time recognition (optional using OpenCV)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras / Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Output
- Classified hand gestures with high accuracy
- Visual feedback on predicted class labels
- Optional: Real-time gesture recognition using webcam

## 📁 Files
- `gesture_dataset/`: Contains training images categorized into folders
- `hand_gesture_model.ipynb`: Full implementation
- `preprocessing.py`: Helper script for image loading and transformation

## 🏢 Internship
This task was completed as part of the **Skillscraft Technology** Machine Learning Internship Program 2025.
